# React Template

This is a React Template built by Pearse Hutson. It is designed to be used in the WebStorm IDE, but can be useful in other environments as well. Gulp is used to build the app into the dist directory, and includes a watcher task that will rebuild on changes to app.js, and includes live-reloading.
 
## Getting started
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `gulp watch` or run the JS Debug configuration in WebStorm

## WIP Notice
This template is a work in progress. Currently it only watches one app.js file. As my needs expand, I will be expanding this template.
